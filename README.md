# discern

Quickly identify and learn how to dispose of harmful household items.

## How it works
Using a custom machine learning model, the app will attempt to figure out what what harmful household item it most closely resembles. 

Then, it provides information on how to dispose of the item, and provides local disposal sites.

The app allows the user to keep track of the items that need special disposal.
