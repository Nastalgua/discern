# Appliances

If the appliance is still working, it may be helpful to donate it to a shelter or home. 

If the appliance isn't working, check out one of the locations below. 

Depending on the appliance, you may need a special way to deal with it.

### Refrigerators and Freezers
Schedule a removal with professionals. Contract your local department of public works to schedule the removal.

### Microwaves
You can usually recycle broken microwaves as scrap metal. It's likely that your local authorities will host a recucling day, so you can drop off these metal boxes there.
